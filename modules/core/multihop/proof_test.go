/*
todo:
Given chains {A, B, ..., Y, Z}, and existing connections between {AB, BC, ..., YZ}, add minimal tests for:
  - generate proofs for any key/value pair on A, B, ..., Y
  - verify proofs on Z
This is to a general case for multihop ibc semantics for which key/values are for channels and packets only.
